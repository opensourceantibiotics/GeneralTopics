This repository has been used as a place to list, and discuss, all the To Do items in the Open Source Antibiotics - click on "Issues" above to see them all. There are still many items outstanding. Over time we anticipate that target speciifc repositories will be created.

In addition the wiki pages provide a general introduction to the need for novel antibiotics and you can also follow the project on Twitter (https://twitter.com/OSantibiotics)

You may ask "who is Open Source Antibiotics?" You can tell who is contributing from the discussions in the Issues tabs of each "repository". This site was started by [Chris Swain](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisswain) with help from [Matthew Todd](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/pharmacy/people/professor-matthew-todd). The Mur Ligase project originated with data from a collaboration between [Chris Dowson](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/lifesci/people/cdowson/) at Warwick University and [Frank von Delft](https://www.thesgc.org/node/9489) and [Paul Brennan](https://www.thesgc.org/node/9496) at the University of Oxford/Structural Genomics Consortium. To reach people, it's best to create, or comment on, an Issue. We'll set up an email address too.
